Since my **PhD** in **Physics**, 10 years ago, I have been working on **data analysis**, using **statistics** 
and **machine learning** techniques in both academic and commercial environments.

* I have experience as **Data Scientist** consultant in industry, with projects ranging from predictive analytics to vehicles gps tracks clustering.

* I analysed DNA sequencing data and assembled genomes as a **Bioinformatics** at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [[Paper]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03996-z)

* I have worked on large and complex dataset in Particle Physics, 
trying to unravel the internal structure of protons with data cleaning, multivariate regressions and compatibility tests [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.5070.pdf).


## My own BioInformatics tools
* My factotum tool for fast genomic sequences manipulation and interrogation [seq_factotum](https://github.com/fg6/seq_factotum)

* Genome visualisation pipeline (uses [ACT](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis-comparison-tool-act) and [circlize](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/circlize)) [forACT](https://github.com/fg6/forACT)

## Tutorials
* Use **Folium** to Map your geografical data  
  keywords: **python, geo, map, geo-viz, visualization, gps coordinates, heatmap, add layers, animated map**
