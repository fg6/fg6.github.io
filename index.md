Since during my **PhD** in **Physics**, 10 years ago, I have been working on data analysis and using statistics 
and machine learning techniques in both academic and commercial environments.

I have worked on large and complex dataset in Particle Physics, 
trying to unravel the internal structure of protons with data cleaning, multivariate regressions and compatibility tests [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.5070.pdf).

I have worked in **Bioinformatics**, analysing DNA sequencing data and combining them toghether to build up genomes [[Paper]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03996-z)

And now, I am working as a **Data Scientist** consultant in industry, where my projects range from predictive analytics for cooling system failures to clusterising vehicles gps tracks.
